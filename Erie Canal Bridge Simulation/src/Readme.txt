    cs251: CoPaDS Assignment Status, Analysis and Feedback

    My name is:      Jacob Manelius

    Assignment is:   Erie Canal Bridge Simulation


    ============= Status ===============
    Remove choices inside the [] below to leave one answer on the next line:

    My program [works] [] [] [] [].

    Explain the above answer as needed, and provide details of your situation.


    ============= Analysis =============
    Given this situation: 
    The South side is empty, the bridge is empty, there is one car
    on the North side that has not crossed, and a car is arriving at the South. 

    1. What should the arriving car do?
Wait for the car on the north side to cross, after it does it should cross.


    2a. What happens if the arriving car gets on the bridge?
Then it would either cross the bridge or deadlock, depending on how the code was written.

    2b. How might getting on the bridge affect the simulation if all cars
    behaved that way in such a situation?
If all cars always got on the bridge then the program would deadlock. The cars don't back up.



    ============= Feedback =============
    What did I learn?

How to use Synchronization and the debugger when using threads.
I learned to make sure my if conditions have elses.



    What was easy about this assignment?

Actually most of it was pretty easy as soon as you understand synchronized methods.



    What gave you trouble? Describe specific problems, you had, if any.

As always, reading the assignment description and deciphering it is not easy for me.
I struggle with knowing where to start but once I do its not so bad.
I had a situation with nested if conditions where only the first had an else despite my wish that if any failed they would execute the else. 2 hours to find that one.



    What can the instructor do to improve this assignment?

Short of suggesting a starting place not much.


    Would you have like to add anything further?

I liked this assignment, it wasn't the easiest thing but it was very doable. I feel like I learned something important from it.
